# LinuxSetup
My personal simple setup script for when distro hopping/reinstalling

Remember to execute this script using 
```
chmod a+x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Will install packages such as `git emacs-nox gnome-tweaks zsh terminator tmux neofetch nautilus vim tree steam dconf-editor htop curl gcc`
And `google-chrome` and `discord`
